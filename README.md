# First Steps in Haskell

This repository contains my first steps in the Haskell programming language. The purpose of this study is to learn a new programming language that will be used in the "Linguagens de Programação" course at the Universidade de Brasília during the second semester of 2024.

## Why Haskell?

Haskell is a functional programming language with a strong type system and extensive use of recursion.

Since the functional paradigm emphasizes specifying what to do rather than how to do it, this approach provides a holistic perspective on modern programming concepts, such as abstraction in functions and data types, overloading, polymorphism, and generalization.

Haskell was chosen because it enforces programming using the functional paradigm exclusively.
